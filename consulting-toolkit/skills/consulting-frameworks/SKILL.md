  Core consulting thinking frameworks and methodologies for structuring
  business problems, communicating findings, analyzing strategy, building
  financial models, and designing operations. Use when any agent or command
  needs to apply MECE decomposition, pyramid principle, hypothesis-driven
  analysis, issue trees, SCR communication, Porter's Five Forces,
  TAM/SAM/SOM market sizing, value chain analysis, NPV/IRR decision
  criteria, build/buy/partner evaluation, RACI matrices, or any standard
  consulting framework. This skill provides procedural guidance — not just
  framework names, but how to apply them correctly.

# Consulting Frameworks

Select the reference file matching your task. Each contains procedural guidance, application steps, quality checks, and examples.

## Framework Selection Guide

| Task | Reference File | Key Frameworks |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Decompose a problem, build an issue tree, structure hypotheses | [references/structuring.md](references/structuring.md) | MECE, Issue Trees, Hypothesis-Driven |
| Write executive summaries, build storylines, craft action titles | [references/communication.md](references/communication.md) | Pyramid Principle, SCR, Action Titles |
| Analyze markets, competitive dynamics, or growth options | [references/strategy.md](references/strategy.md) | Porter's Five Forces, TAM/SAM/SOM, Value Chain, 3 Horizons, Ansoff |
| Build business cases, evaluate investments, model costs | [references/financial.md](references/financial.md) | NPV/IRR, Build/Buy/Partner, Zero-Based Budgeting, Should-Cost |
| Design accountability structures, operating models, processes | [references/operational.md](references/operational.md) | RACI, Operating Model Canvas, Spans & Layers, Lean/Six Sigma |

## Cross-Framework Patterns

Most consulting deliverables combine multiple frameworks:

- **Market sizing** = TAM/SAM/SOM (strategy) + MECE segmentation (structuring) + Pyramid Principle (communication)
- **Due diligence** = Porter's Five Forces (strategy) + Issue Tree (structuring) + NPV/IRR (financial)
- **Business case** = Build/Buy/Partner (financial) + RACI (operational) + SCR (communication)
- **Transformation roadmap** = Operating Model (operational) + 3 Horizons (strategy) + Hypothesis-Driven (structuring)

Read the primary reference file for your task, then pull from adjacent files as needed.
