# Operational Frameworks

## RACI Matrix

### What It Is
An accountability framework that clarifies who does what on every key activity. Prevents the two most common organizational failures: nobody owns it, or everybody owns it.

### Roles
- **R** (Responsible): Does the work. Can be multiple people, but keep it tight
- **A** (Accountable): Makes the final decision and owns the outcome. Exactly one per activity — no exceptions
- **C** (Consulted): Provides input before the decision. Two-way communication
- **I** (Informed): Notified after the decision. One-way communication

### How to Build
1. List activities/decisions in rows (be specific — "approve budget" not "finance stuff")
2. List roles/people in columns
3. Assign exactly one A per row
4. Assign R to those who do the work (minimum viable set)
5. C and I as needed — err on fewer (too many C's slows everything down)

### Common Patterns to Catch
- **No A assigned**: Nobody owns the outcome. Fix immediately
- **Multiple A's**: Shared accountability = no accountability. Pick one
- **Too many C's**: Everyone has a veto. Limit to those whose input genuinely changes the decision
- **A without R**: The accountable person has no one to delegate to — they're implicitly R as well
- **R without A**: Work being done with nobody empowered to make decisions about it

### Quality Check
- Every row has exactly one A
- Activities are specific enough to be actionable
- People assigned R actually have capacity and capability
- The matrix has been validated with the people named in it

## Operating Model Canvas

### What It Is
A framework for designing how an organization delivers value — the bridge between strategy ("what we want to achieve") and execution ("how we work day-to-day").

### Components
1. **Value Proposition**: What the organization delivers to customers (from strategy)
2. **Value Chain**: The key activities that deliver the proposition (primary and support)
3. **Organization**: How people are grouped — by function, business unit, geography, process
4. **Governance**: How decisions are made — decision rights, escalation paths, committees
5. **Information**: What data flows where — systems, reports, KPIs
6. **Suppliers & Partners**: External relationships that enable the value chain
7. **Location**: Where work happens — centralized, distributed, nearshore/offshore

### How to Apply
1. Start with value proposition (this constrains everything downstream)
2. Map the current operating model across all 7 components
3. Identify misalignments: strategy says "customer intimacy" but organization is structured by product, not customer segment
4. Design the target operating model by adjusting components to align with strategy
5. Gap analysis: current vs. target for each component
6. Sequence the transformation: which changes enable others?

### Quality Check
- All 7 components addressed (common gap: governance and information are often skipped)
- Clear link from strategy to operating model choices
- Target model is feasible (not an idealized future with no constraints)
- Transition plan exists (you can't redesign everything at once)

## Spans & Layers

### What It Is
An organizational design framework focused on management structure — how many layers exist between the CEO and the front line (layers), and how many direct reports each manager has (span of control).

### Benchmarks
- **Span of control**: 6-10 for operational managers, 5-8 for senior leaders, 3-5 for highly specialized roles
- **Layers**: Most organizations function well with 5-7 layers. More than 8 layers typically signals over-management
- **Manager-to-individual-contributor ratio**: 1:6 to 1:10 is healthy. Below 1:4 suggests excess management overhead

### Diagnostic Questions
1. How many layers from CEO to front line? (Count by following any reporting chain)
2. What is the average span at each layer? (Sum of direct reports ÷ number of managers)
3. Where are spans abnormally narrow (<4)? These indicate potential redundant layers
4. Where are spans abnormally wide (>12)? These indicate potential management gaps
5. How many "pass-through" managers exist? (Managers with only 1-2 direct reports who primarily relay information)

### How to Optimize
1. Map current spans and layers across the entire organization
2. Identify compression opportunities: layers where spans are <4 can often be collapsed
3. Model the target structure: wider spans, fewer layers, empowered front-line teams
4. Estimate savings: each removed management layer typically reduces headcount costs by 10-15% in that layer
5. Assess risks: faster decision-making vs. reduced oversight, potential loss of mentorship capacity

### Quality Check
- Analysis is based on actual reporting data, not org charts (which are often outdated)
- Recommendations account for variation by function (sales can support wider spans than R&D)
- Transition plan addresses redeployment of affected managers
- Impact on decision speed, not just cost, is evaluated

## Lean / Six Sigma

### What It Is
Complementary process optimization methodologies. Lean eliminates waste (anything that doesn't add customer value). Six Sigma reduces variation (defects, errors, inconsistency).

### Lean — The 8 Wastes (DOWNTIME)
- **D**efects: Rework, corrections, errors
- **O**verproduction: Making more than demanded
- **W**aiting: Idle time between process steps
- **N**on-utilized talent: Underusing people's skills
- **T**ransportation: Unnecessary movement of materials
- **I**nventory: Excess stock or work-in-progress
- **M**otion: Unnecessary movement of people
- **E**xtra processing: Work beyond what the customer values

### Six Sigma — DMAIC
1. **Define**: What is the problem? What is the defect? What does the customer expect?
2. **Measure**: What is current performance? Baseline the defect rate
3. **Analyze**: What causes the defects? Root cause analysis (5 Whys, fishbone diagram)
4. **Improve**: What changes eliminate the root causes? Test solutions
5. **Control**: How do we sustain the improvement? Monitoring, standard work, control charts

### When to Use Each
- **Lean**: When the problem is speed, cost, or throughput — too slow, too expensive, too much waste
- **Six Sigma**: When the problem is quality or consistency — too many errors, too much variation, unreliable output
- **Both together**: Most operational transformations benefit from both — eliminate waste (Lean) then reduce variation in what remains (Six Sigma)

### Quality Check
- Problem definition is specific and measurable (not "improve operations")
- Current-state process is mapped before redesigning
- Root causes identified (not just symptoms)
- Improvements are sustained through control mechanisms, not just initial effort
