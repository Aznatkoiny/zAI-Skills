# Communication Frameworks

## Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)

### What It Is
A communication structure where the answer comes first, supported by grouped arguments, each backed by evidence. The audience gets the conclusion immediately, then the supporting logic.

### Structure
```
Governing Thought (the answer)
├── Pillar 1 (supporting argument)
│   ├── Evidence 1a
│   └── Evidence 1b
├── Pillar 2 (supporting argument)
│   ├── Evidence 2a
│   └── Evidence 2b
└── Pillar 3 (supporting argument)
    ├── Evidence 3a
    └── Evidence 3b
```

### How to Apply
1. **Start with the governing thought**: One sentence that answers the question the audience has. Must be assertive — not a topic, not a question, not a hedge
   - Good: "We recommend acquiring Target X at up to €200M, generating 18% IRR with payback in Year 3"
   - Bad: "We have completed our analysis of Target X" (says nothing)
2. **Build 3-4 supporting pillars**: Each pillar is MECE with the others, each strong enough to stand independently
3. **Sequence pillars persuasively**: Options include:
   - Situation → Analysis → Recommendation (when audience needs context)
   - Strongest argument first (when audience is skeptical)
   - Logical flow: market → competitive → financial (when building a case)
4. **Back each pillar with evidence**: Data points, analyses, examples — each mapped to exactly one pillar

### Ordering Logic Within Groups
- **Deductive**: Major premise → minor premise → conclusion ("All markets above 5% CAGR are attractive → This market is 6.2% CAGR → This market is attractive")
- **Inductive**: Similar ideas grouped to reveal a pattern ("Revenue up, margins up, cash flow up → Financial performance is strengthening across all metrics")
- **Chronological**: When sequence matters ("Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3")
- **Structural**: When completeness matters ("Commercial → Financial → Operational" for DD)

### Quality Check
- Governing thought is a single assertive sentence
- Reading only the governing thought + pillar headings tells the full story
- Each pillar is MECE with siblings
- No pillar requires another pillar's evidence to make sense
- Evidence under each pillar actually supports that pillar (not a different one)

## SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution)

### What It Is
A three-part narrative structure for executive communication. Establishes context, creates tension, then resolves it with a recommendation.

### Structure
- **Situation**: The current state — facts the audience already knows or accepts. This anchors shared understanding
- **Complication**: What changed, what's at stake, what tension exists. This is why we're talking
- **Resolution**: The recommended action. This is the answer

### How to Apply
1. **Situation** (1-3 sentences): State only facts the audience agrees with. No new information, no controversy
   - "Client X has grown 15% annually for 5 years through organic expansion in Western Europe"
2. **Complication** (1-3 sentences): Introduce the challenge, change, or threat. Create the "why now" urgency
   - "Growth is decelerating as core markets mature, and two well-funded competitors are entering the mid-market segment"
3. **Resolution** (1-2 sentences): State the recommendation directly. This becomes the governing thought
   - "We recommend Client X acquire a mid-market player to defend share and access the Eastern European growth corridor before competitors establish positions"

### SCR Variants
- **SQR** (Situation-Question-Resolution): When the audience has a question rather than a problem. Replace Complication with the question being asked
- **SCQA** (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer): Extended version that explicitly states the question before answering. Useful for complex topics where the right question isn't obvious

### When to Use
- Executive summaries (the standard format)
- Opening slide of any presentation
- Email recommendations to senior stakeholders
- Any communication where the audience's time is limited

### Quality Check
- Situation contains only agreed-upon facts
- Complication creates genuine tension or urgency
- Resolution directly addresses the complication
- The whole SCR fits in 5-7 sentences maximum

## Action Titles

### What It Is
Slide titles written as complete, assertive sentences that convey the insight — not topic labels. If someone reads only the slide titles in sequence, they should understand the full argument.

### How to Write Them
1. Write the insight first, then design the slide to support it
2. Use a complete sentence with a subject and verb
3. Include the "so what" — the implication, not just the fact
4. Quantify when possible — numbers make titles concrete and credible

### Examples

| Bad (Topic Label) | Good (Action Title) |
|---|---|
| Market Overview | The European cold chain market will reach €62B by 2030, driven by pharmaceutical and fresh food demand |
| Competitive Landscape | Three players control 41% of the market, but fragmentation in the mid-market creates an acquisition window |
| Financial Analysis | Partnership with Company Z delivers 22% IRR with breakeven in Year 3 under conservative assumptions |
| Key Risks | Three regulatory risks require mitigation before close, but none are deal-breakers |
| Recommendations | We recommend proceeding at up to €2.1B, conditional on resolving customer concentration risk |

### Common Failures
- **Describes the slide**: "This slide shows market growth" → Should state what the growth means
- **Asks a question**: "Is the market attractive?" → Should answer it
- **Hedges**: "The market may be growing" → Take a position
- **Too long**: >2 lines means the thinking isn't sharp enough
- **Disconnected from visual**: Title says one thing, chart shows another

### Quality Check
- Read titles in sequence — does the story flow?
- Does each title state an insight, not a topic?
- Could the title stand without the slide body and still be meaningful?
- Does the visual on the slide directly support the title's claim?
