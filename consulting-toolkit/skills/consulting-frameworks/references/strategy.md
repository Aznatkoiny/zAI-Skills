# Strategy Frameworks

## Porter's Five Forces

### What It Is
An industry attractiveness framework analyzing five competitive pressures that determine profitability potential.

### The Five Forces
1. **Threat of New Entrants**: How easy is it for new players to enter?
   - Barriers: capital requirements, economies of scale, regulatory licenses, brand loyalty, switching costs, distribution access
   - High barriers = attractive for incumbents
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: Can suppliers dictate terms?
   - Few suppliers, differentiated inputs, high switching costs = strong supplier power
   - Many commoditized suppliers = weak supplier power
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: Can customers dictate terms?
   - Few large buyers, low switching costs, commoditized product = strong buyer power
   - Fragmented buyers, differentiated product = weak buyer power
4. **Threat of Substitutes**: Can the need be met differently?
   - Not just direct competitors — different solutions to the same problem
   - Example: Video calls substitute for business flights (different product, same job-to-be-done)
5. **Competitive Rivalry**: How intense is existing competition?
   - Many equal-sized competitors, slow growth, high fixed costs, low differentiation = intense rivalry

### How to Apply
1. Assess each force as Low / Medium / High with specific evidence
2. Identify which 1-2 forces most constrain industry profitability
3. State the implication: "Industry attractiveness is [high/moderate/low] because [dominant force]"
4. Connect to the client's position: How do they fare relative to these forces?

### Quality Check
- Every force rating has supporting evidence, not just a label
- Substitutes include non-obvious alternatives (not just direct competitors)
- Analysis concludes with a clear "so what" for industry attractiveness

## TAM/SAM/SOM

### What It Is
A hierarchical market sizing framework that narrows from total opportunity to realistic addressable share.

### Definitions
- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market): The total global revenue opportunity if 100% market share were achieved. The theoretical ceiling
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market): The portion of TAM within the client's reach — filtered by geography, segment, channel, and capability constraints
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market): The realistic share of SAM the client can capture in the planning horizon, given competition and execution constraints

### How to Size

**Top-Down Approach** (start from industry totals, narrow):
```
TAM: Global market reports → total industry revenue
SAM: TAM × (relevant segments) × (relevant geographies) × (relevant channels)
SOM: SAM × (realistic share based on competitive position, typically 1-5% for new entrants, 10-20% for established players)
```

**Bottom-Up Approach** (start from unit economics, build up):
```
Target customers × penetration rate × average revenue per customer = SOM
SOM ÷ market share = SAM
```

### Best Practice
- Always run both approaches and reconcile. If they're within 20%, confidence is reasonable. If they diverge >2x, investigate the assumptions driving the gap
- Source each number: "[Statista, 2025]" or "[Analyst calculation: 500K customers × €2K ARPU × 15% penetration]"
- State the year and currency for every figure
- Use ranges when confidence is low: "SAM estimated at €8-12B"

### Quality Check
- TAM > SAM > SOM (if not, the definitions are wrong)
- Both top-down and bottom-up approaches attempted
- Every number sourced or clearly labeled as an assumption
- Growth rates specified for each tier (they often differ)

## Value Chain Analysis

### What It Is
Maps the sequence of activities that create and deliver value to the end customer, identifying where value is created, captured, and at risk.

### Standard Value Chain (after Porter)
```
Primary Activities:
Inbound Logistics → Operations → Outbound Logistics → Marketing & Sales → Service

Support Activities:
Infrastructure | HR | Technology | Procurement
```

### How to Apply
1. Map the industry-specific value chain (not the generic Porter version)
2. For each stage, identify:
   - **Who plays**: Which companies operate at this stage?
   - **Value created**: What margin or value-add occurs?
   - **Competitive dynamics**: Is this stage consolidated or fragmented?
   - **Where the client sits**: Which stages does the client own?
3. Identify value migration: Where is margin shifting? Which stages are gaining or losing pricing power?
4. Strategic implication: Should the client integrate forward/backward, or specialize?

### Quality Check
- Value chain is industry-specific, not generic
- Each stage has estimated margins or value share
- Analysis identifies where value is migrating and why

## 3 Horizons

### What It Is
A growth pipeline framework for sequencing investments across timeframes.

### The Three Horizons
- **Horizon 1** (0-2 years): Defend and extend the core business. Optimize, grow share, improve profitability. Funds H2 and H3
- **Horizon 2** (2-5 years): Scale emerging businesses. New markets, new products, acquisitions. Requires investment but should show traction
- **Horizon 3** (5+ years): Create options for future growth. Experiments, bets, R&D, partnerships. Most will fail; a few will become H2

### How to Apply
1. Classify the client's portfolio of initiatives across horizons
2. Assess balance: Over-investment in H1 starves future growth; over-investment in H3 risks current profitability
3. Ensure funding flow: H1 profits fund H2/H3 investments
4. Define metrics per horizon: H1 = revenue/margin, H2 = growth rate/market share, H3 = option value/learning

### Quality Check
- Each horizon has specific initiatives, not just labels
- There is a clear mechanism for H1 profits to fund H2/H3
- H3 options have defined learning milestones (not just "we'll figure it out")

## Ansoff Matrix

### What It Is
A 2x2 growth strategy framework crossing products (existing vs. new) with markets (existing vs. new).

### The Four Strategies
|  | Existing Products | New Products |
|--|---|---|
| **Existing Markets** | Market Penetration (lowest risk) | Product Development |
| **New Markets** | Market Development | Diversification (highest risk) |

### How to Apply
1. Classify the client's growth options into the four quadrants
2. Assess risk vs. return for each option
3. Sequence: Typically exhaust penetration before moving to development or diversification
4. Identify which quadrant the engagement's strategic question falls into

### Quality Check
- Growth options are classified into the correct quadrant
- Risk assessment accompanies each option
- Recommendation considers sequencing (don't lead with diversification if penetration has headroom)
