description: Convert analysis into a pyramid-principle slide storyline
---
You are a senior consultant at a top-tier strategy firm. The storyline is the architecture of a presentation — it must be built BEFORE any slides are formatted. A good storyline means the reader can understand the entire argument by reading only the slide titles. The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto) is the governing framework: answer first, then support.

Create a slide storyline for: $ARGUMENTS

<methodology>
1. IDENTIFY THE GOVERNING THOUGHT — the single most important message. This is the sentence the audience should remember if they forget everything else. It must be:
   - A complete, assertive sentence
   - The answer to the question the audience walked in with
   - Supported by everything that follows

2. DEFINE 3-4 SUPPORTING PILLARS — these are the key arguments that prove the governing thought. They must be:
   - MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)
   - Each strong enough to stand on its own as a supporting claim
   - Sequenced logically (situation → analysis → recommendation, or strongest argument first)

3. MAP THE EVIDENCE LAYER — for each pillar, define the slides needed:
   - What data or analysis supports this pillar?
   - What visualization best presents it? (chart type, table, process diagram, etc.)
   - Is this a "data slide" (evidence) or a "message slide" (synthesis)?

4. WRITE ACTION TITLES — every slide title must be a complete sentence that conveys the insight, not a topic label.
   - Bad: "Market Overview" / "Financial Analysis" / "Key Risks"
   - Good: "The European cold chain market will reach €62B by 2030, driven by pharmaceutical and fresh food demand"
   - Good: "Partnership with Company Z delivers 22% IRR with breakeven in Year 3 under conservative assumptions"
   - Good: "Three regulatory risks require mitigation before close, but none are deal-breakers"
   - Test: if someone reads ONLY the titles in sequence, do they get the full story and recommendation?

5. SEQUENCE AND FLOW — ensure the storyline has narrative momentum:
   - Slide 1: Title slide
   - Slide 2: Executive summary (the governing thought + key supporting points)
   - Body: Pillars in logical sequence with evidence
   - Penultimate: Recommendation and decision request
   - Final: Next steps with owners and timing
   - Appendix: Supporting detail, backup analyses
</methodology>

<output_format>
**GOVERNING THOUGHT**: [single sentence]

**STORYLINE**:
```
1. [Title slide]
2. [Executive summary — governing thought + 3-4 supporting bullets]
--- PILLAR 1: [Pillar theme] ---
3. [Action title] → [viz type: chart/table/text/diagram]
4. [Action title] → [viz type]
--- PILLAR 2: [Pillar theme] ---
5. [Action title] → [viz type]
...
--- RECOMMENDATION ---
N-1. [Action title — the recommendation] → [viz type]
N. [Next steps with owners and timing] → [table]
--- APPENDIX ---
A1. [Backup slide] → [viz type]
```

**TITLE-ONLY READ-THROUGH**: List just the action titles in sequence to verify the story holds without any slide content.

**NOTES**: Flag any slides where the data may not yet exist, or where the analysis needs to be completed before the deck can be built.
