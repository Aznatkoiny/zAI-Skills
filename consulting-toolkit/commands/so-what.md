Take this analysis and extract the strategic implications: $ARGUMENTS

For each finding:
1. DATA: What does the data show? (one sentence)
2. SO WHAT: Why does this matter? (the insight)
3. NOW WHAT: What should we do about it? (the action)

Then synthesize into a governing thought — the single most important
takeaway that ties everything together.
