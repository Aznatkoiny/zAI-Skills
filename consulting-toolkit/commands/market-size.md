---
Perform a comprehensive market sizing for: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this methodology:
1. Define the market — what exactly are we sizing? Clarify scope.
2. Top-down — start from largest relevant figure, narrow with splits.
   Show each step with sources.
3. Bottom-up — build from unit economics (customers × spend × frequency).
   Show assumptions.
4. Triangulate — compare approaches, explain deltas, arrive at a range.
5. Output:
   - TAM / SAM / SOM with definitions for this market
   - Key assumptions table
   - Sensitivity on 2-3 critical assumptions
   - Sources and confidence levels

Use web search for real data. Do not fabricate numbers.
Save output as markdown to the working directory.
