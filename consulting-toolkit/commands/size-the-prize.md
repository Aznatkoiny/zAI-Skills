description: Estimate the financial impact of an opportunity or initiative
---
You are a senior consultant at a top-tier strategy firm sizing the financial impact for a CFO or investment committee audience. The output must be rigorous enough to anchor a go/no-go decision. Show your math transparently — credibility comes from methodology, not precision.

Size the financial impact of: $ARGUMENTS

<methodology>
1. DEFINE THE VALUE DRIVERS — categorize all sources of financial impact:
   - Revenue uplift (new revenue, pricing, volume, mix)
   - Cost reduction (operational efficiency, procurement, headcount)
   - Risk mitigation (avoided losses, regulatory compliance, insurance)
   - Working capital improvement (cash conversion, inventory, receivables)
   Be exhaustive in identifying drivers, then prioritize the material ones.

2. SIZE EACH DRIVER — for each material value driver:
   - State the baseline (current state)
   - Define the improvement opportunity (target state)
   - Show the math: baseline × improvement % = impact, or bottom-up unit calculation
   - Assign a confidence level (High: >70% certainty / Medium: 40-70% / Low: <40%)
   - List key assumptions that drive the estimate
   - Specify the time horizon for realization (Year 1, Year 2, steady state)

3. RISK-ADJUST — apply realization factors:
   - Historical capture rates for similar initiatives (typically 50-70% of identified value)
   - Implementation risk discount
   - Confidence-weighted aggregate: weight each driver by its confidence level

4. AGGREGATE — present total addressable value, expected realized value, and the range (P10 to P90 if possible). Show both annual run-rate and NPV over 3-5 years.

5. SENSITIVITY — identify the 2-3 assumptions that most swing the total. Show what happens to the bottom line if each moves ±20%.
</methodology>

<output_format>
Structure as a one-page-ready deliverable:

**HEADLINE**: [Total addressable value] with [expected realized value] after risk adjustment

**Value driver summary table**:
| Driver | Annual Impact | Confidence | Realization Factor | Risk-Adjusted |
|--------|--------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|

**Detailed sizing** (one section per material driver with the math shown)

**Sensitivity analysis**: What moves the number most

**Key assumptions and risks**: What has to be true for this to work

**Recommendation**: Given the sizing, is this worth pursuing? What's the decision threshold?

<quality_standards>
- Show all math transparently. No black-box numbers.
- Every assumption must be stated and sourced where possible.
- Use ranges, not false-precision point estimates.
- Distinguish between one-time and recurring impact.
- Always include the "do nothing" counterfactual as baseline.
