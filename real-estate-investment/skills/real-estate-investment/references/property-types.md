## Residential (SFR & Small Multifamily)

### BRRRR Method Framework

**Stage-by-Stage Financial Analysis:**

1. **Buy**: Acquire property below market value
   - Calculate maximum purchase price: (ARV × 70%) - Repair Costs
   - Track acquisition costs and closing fees

2. **Rehab**: Add value through strategic renovations
   - Track rehab budget and holding costs during renovation
   - Monitor labor, materials, permits

3. **Rent**: Stabilize with tenant income
   - Project cash flow post-stabilization
   - Apply 1% Rule and 50% Rule for screening

4. **Refinance**: Extract equity after property appreciates
   - Calculate cash-back after refinancing
   - Determine capital available for next deal

5. **Repeat**: Recycle capital into new deals
   - Calculate total invested capital per property
   - Track portfolio velocity

**Required Calculator Functions:**
- Up-front capital requirement
- Closing costs and rehab budget
- Holding costs during renovation
- Cash flow projections post-stabilization
- Cash-back estimation after refinancing
- Total invested capital per property

---

### ARV Estimation Methodology

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Find Comparable Properties**
   - Recent sales within last 6 months
   - Same neighborhood, similar size and condition

2. **Calculate Price Per Square Foot**
   - Formula: ARV = Avg Cost Per SF of Comps × Subject Property SF

3. **Adjust for Differences**
   - Account for variations in bedrooms, bathrooms, finished basements, features

4. **Include Renovation Costs**
   - Factor cosmetic updates and significant repairs

**Critical Requirements:**
- Comps must be sold within last 6 months (current market conditions)
- Properties must be truly comparable (close enough for valid comparison)
- Adjust for material differences affecting value

---

### Rules of Thumb

**The 1% Rule**
- **Formula**: Monthly rental income ≥ 1% of purchase price
- **Purpose**: Quick screening for income potential
- **Limitation**: Doesn't account for taxes, insurance, maintenance
- **Use**: Initial "back of napkin" litmus test only

**The 50% Rule**
- **Formula**: Total operating expenses = ~50% of gross rental income
- **Coverage**: Taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs, maintenance
- **Exclusion**: Does NOT include mortgage principal and interest
- **Use**: Quick expense estimation for single-family properties

**The 70% Rule**
- **Formula**: Maximum Purchase Price = (ARV × 70%) - Repair Costs
- **Purpose**: Ensures adequate profit margin for fix-and-flip
- **Application**: Primarily for fix-and-flip, NOT buy-and-hold
- **Rationale**: 30% margin covers holding costs, closing costs, realtor fees, profit

**Application Sequence:**
1. Use 1% Rule to screen for income potential
2. Apply 50% Rule to estimate operating expenses
3. Use 70% Rule for fix-and-flip maximum purchase price

---

### House Hacking Analysis

**FHA/VA Financing Advantages:**
- Down payment: 3.5% (FHA) vs. 20-25% (investment property)
- Better interest rates than investment loans
- Lenders count projected rental income toward qualification
- Self-Sufficiency Test (3-4 units): 75% of rental income must cover monthly mortgage + HOA

**Owner-Occupancy Requirements:**
- Must live in property for minimum 1 year
- Moving out early violates loan terms and triggers penalties

**Effective Housing Cost Calculation:**

```
Effective Housing Cost = Total Mortgage Payment - Rental Income from Other Units
```

**Typical Financial Benefits (5-year horizon):**
- Reduced annual housing costs: ~$7,700/year
- Principal reduction after 5 years: ~$26,650
- Equity position (3% appreciation): ~$106,300

---

### Rent-to-Price Ratio Benchmarks

**Price-to-Rent Ratio Interpretation:**
- **Below 15**: Buying more budget-friendly than renting
- **15-21**: Balanced market (both viable)
- **Above 21**: Renting more affordable; home prices high vs. rents

**Alternative Interpretation:**
- **1-15**: More favorable to buy
- **16-20**: Better to rent
- **21+**: Much better to rent

**Market Examples (by ratio):**
- **Lowest** (favoring purchase): Detroit (8), Cleveland (11), Baltimore (13), Philadelphia (14), Chicago (15)
- **Highest** (favoring rental): San Jose (45), San Francisco (36)
- **Regional Pattern**: Lowest in South/Midwest; highest in West Coast tech hubs

**For Investors**: Use inverse (rent-to-price); higher = better cash flow potential

---

### Expense Ratios by Property Size

**Multifamily (2-4 units):**
- Operating Expense Ratio (OER): 35-45% of gross rental income
- Higher efficiency than SFR due to shared systems and economies of scale

**Single-Family:**
- Operating expenses typically higher on percentage basis than small multifamily
- Lack of shared resources increases per-unit maintenance costs
- Higher reserve necessary (single point of failure)

**Scale Effect:**
- Properties with 150+ units: OER 0.58% lower than smaller properties
- Demonstrates significant economies of scale

**Key Expense Categories:**
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Utilities
- Maintenance and repairs
- Property management: 8-10% of gross rent (residential)
- Vacancy allowance: 5-10% (market-dependent)
- Capital expenditures reserve

---

## Commercial & Large Multifamily

### Per-Unit & Per-SF Metrics

**Price Per Door/Unit:**
- **Calculation**: Total Property Price ÷ Number of Units
- **Example**: $2M / 20 units = $100,000 per unit
- **Quick Benchmark**: <$25,000 per door typically indicates good cap rate and cash flow
- **Limitation**: Price per door alone shouldn't be sole decision factor

**Other Per-Unit Metrics:**
- Rent Per Unit: Average monthly rent across all units
- Expense Per Unit: Total operating expenses ÷ units
- NOI Per Unit: Net Operating Income ÷ units

**Per-Square-Foot Metrics (Office/Retail/Industrial):**
- Price Per SF: Total acquisition cost ÷ total square footage
- Rent Per SF: Annual rent ÷ total leasable square footage
- Expense Per SF: Operating expenses ÷ total square footage

**Application**: Enables comparison across different building sizes and markets

---

### Expense Ratios by Asset Class

**Operating Expense Ratio = Operating Expenses ÷ Gross Revenue**

**Multifamily (5+ units):** 35-45%
- Lower end: Newer Class A properties with efficient systems
- Higher end: Older Class B/C with deferred maintenance

**Office:** 35-55%
- Varies significantly based on lease structure (NNN vs. Gross)
- Class A downtown towers: typically 40-50%

**Retail:** 30-40% typical range (can reach 60-80% for certain formats)
- Heavily dependent on NNN vs. Gross lease structure

**Industrial:** 15-25%
- Lowest of all commercial property types
- Simple building systems and lower maintenance requirements

**NOI Relationship**: NOI % = 100% - OER

---

### Lease Structure Impact on NOI

**Triple Net (NNN) Lease:**
- **Tenant Pays**: Base rent + property taxes + insurance + CAM
- **Example**: $20.00/SF base rent + $3.25/SF NNN expenses
- **Landlord Risk**: Low (tenant bears cost increases)
- **NOI Impact**: Base rent provides net return above all expenses
- **Common In**: Retail, single-tenant commercial

**Full-Service Gross (FSG) Lease:**
- **Tenant Pays**: Single all-inclusive rent rate
- **Landlord Pays**: All operating expenses, including utilities
- **Landlord Risk**: High (expense increases directly reduce NOI)
- **NOI Impact**: Expense increases directly reduce NOI
- **Common In**: Office buildings (especially older Class B/C)

**Modified Gross (MG) Lease:**
- **Structure**: Base year expense stop with tenant paying increases
- **First Year**: Operates like FSG lease
- **Subsequent Years**: Tenant pays pro-rata share of increases above base year
- **Landlord Risk**: Moderate (protected from increases after Year 1)
- **NOI Impact**: Stabilized NOI as increases passed through
- **Common In**: Office buildings, suburban flex space

**Risk Distribution Summary:**
- NNN = Lowest landlord risk, most stable NOI
- Modified Gross = Moderate landlord risk, protected after Year 1
- FSG = Highest landlord risk, variable NOI

---

### Tenant Quality Analysis

**Credit Ratings:**
- **Investment Grade**: BBB-/Baa3 or higher (lowest default risk)
- **Below Investment Grade**: BB+/Ba1 or lower (higher risk, higher cap rates)

**Impact on Property Valuation:**
- Higher credit tenants = lower cap rates = higher property values
- Creditworthiness drives debt amount, interest rates, loan terms
- Building creditworthiness = Sum of tenant credit ratings + lease terms

**Lease Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Rent rolls and tenant mix
- [ ] Lease expiration schedule (rollover risk)
- [ ] Rent escalations (fixed % vs. CPI)
- [ ] Operating expense provisions (who pays what)
- [ ] Tenant improvement allowances
- [ ] Renewal options and terms
- [ ] Credit rating (third-party assessment)
- [ ] Lease term remaining
- [ ] Renewal probability (historical rates)
- [ ] Tenant sales (retail): Sales per SF vs. peers
- [ ] Rent as % of sales (retail): Typically 5-15%
- [ ] Co-tenancy clauses (can tenant terminate if anchor leaves?)
- [ ] Termination rights (early exit options)

---

### Value-Add Underwriting

**Rent Bump Projections:**

**ROI-Based Method:**
- Unit upgrades costing $6,000 should generate $110/month premium for 22% ROI
- Calculation: ($110 × 12) ÷ $6,000 = 22%

**Payback Method:**
- Capital expenditures recovered within 18-24 months
- Example: $1,200 upgrade requires minimum $50/month increase
- Payback: $1,200 ÷ $50 = 24 months

**Rent Growth Components:**
1. **Organic Growth**: Baseline market rent escalation (all units)
2. **Renovation Premium**: Additional increase from upgrades (phased as renovations complete)

**Renovation Cost Per Unit:**
- **Light**: $6,000-$12,000 (paint, flooring, fixtures, appliances)
- **Moderate**: $15,000-$25,000 (kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, appliances)
- **Heavy**: $30,000-$50,000+ (full gut, systems upgrades)

**Stabilization Timeline:**
- **Definition**: Renovations/operational improvements complete, property reaches target occupancy, rent levels, expense ratios
- **Typical Duration**: 2-3 years for phased value-add programs
- **Conservative Underwriting**: Assume minimum 2 years to catch up under-rented units

**Value-Add Pro Forma Approach:**
1. Apply average renovation budget per unit (when scope identical)
2. Apply average monthly rent premium (e.g., $300/month) upon unit return to service
3. Phase renovation premium over time as renovations complete
4. Layer organic rent growth on top of all units annually
5. Model lease-up pace conservatively (not all leases expire simultaneously)

### Class A/B/C Return Profiles

**Class A Properties:**
- **Age**: Typically built within last 15 years
- **Location**: CBD or densely populated urban centers in major cities
- **Characteristics**: Trophy properties, highest-quality finishes, top amenities, professional management, accessible via transit, high-income tenants, low vacancy
- **Rents**: Command highest rents in area
- **Return Profile**: Lower risk, more stable, lower returns; "safest" portfolio addition
- **Investor Profile**: Core investors, institutions, REITs seeking stable income

**Class B Properties:**
- **Age**: Typically 10-20 years old
- **Location**: Slightly less prime than Class A
- **Characteristics**: Newer and well-maintained, average/above-average finishes, fair to good visual appeal, fair parking, functional HVAC, decent management
- **Rents**: At-market rents
- **Return Profile**: Moderate risk, value creation opportunity through improvements
- **Investor Profile**: Value-add investors seeking 15-20% IRR

**Class C Properties:**
- **Age**: Often 20+ years old
- **Location**: Farther from desirable areas
- **Characteristics**: Functional but deferred maintenance, need updating, often lack elevators/central AC, smaller building size
- **Rents**: Below-market (attract tenants seeking most affordable)
- **Return Profile**: Higher risk, higher potential returns through repositioning
- **Investor Profile**: Opportunistic investors seeking 20%+ IRR, willing to take renovation/lease-up risk
- **Repositioning**: Can renovate C to B, but unlikely to reach A (location/size constraints)

**Investment Strategy Implications:**
- **Class A**: Core strategy, income-focused, lower leverage
- **Class B**: Core-plus/value-add, balanced risk-return
- **Class C**: Opportunistic, higher leverage, execution risk

**Note**: Classifications are subjective and market-relative. Class A in mid-size city may be Class B in major metro.

## Short-Term Rental (STR)

### Revenue Modeling

**Core Revenue Formula:**

```
Revenue = ADR × Occupancy Rate × 365 Days - Platform Fees
```

Where:
- **ADR** = Average Daily Rate (nightly price)
- **Occupancy Rate** = % of nights booked annually

**Revenue Projection Example:**
- ADR: $180/night
- Occupancy: 70%
- Days: 30 (monthly)
- Projected Monthly Revenue = $180 × 0.70 × 30 = $3,780

**Platform Fees (2026):**
- **Airbnb Single-Fee Model** (as of Oct 2025): Hosts pay 15.5% service fee; guests see full price
- **Previous Split-Fee Model** (still available for some): Hosts 3% + guests 14.1-16.5%
- **Note**: Independent hosts on native platform may access split-fee; PMS users automatically moved to 15.5%
- **Pricing Markup to Offset 15.5% Fee**: ~18.34%

---

### Key AirDNA Metrics

**RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Rental):**
- **Definition**: Most important STR performance metric
- **Calculation Method 1**: ADR × Occupancy Rate
- **Calculation Method 2**: Total Revenue ÷ Total Available Nights
- **Importance**: Single metric accounting for both pricing power and vacancy

**ADR (Average Daily Rate):**
- **Definition**: Average nightly rate earned across all bookings
- **Recent Trends**: National ADR jumped 24.88% YoY (May 2024-May 2025)
- **Historical Context**: 30%+ annual growth from 2020-2024

**Occupancy Rate:**
- **National Average**: ~54.9% (significant seasonal variation)
- **Strong Markets**: 55%+ occupancy with strong ADR growth
- **Target Benchmark**: 60%+ for profitability

**Revenue Potential:**
- STRs can generate 30% more annually than LTRs
- Average monthly STR earnings: ~$4,300
- **Comparison**: Property renting for $2,000/month as LTR might generate $4,500/month at 80% STR occupancy ($150/night × 80% × 30 days)

**2026 Profitability Targets:**
- RevPAR: $11,990 annually
- Occupancy: 60%
- Gross Margin: 85%

**2026 National Forecast:**
- Occupancy expected to ease by 1%
- ADR forecast to strengthen by 1.5%, with further acceleration in 2027

---

### STR-Specific Expenses

**Furnishing & Setup:**
- **Initial Furnishing**: $15,000-$25,000 (regular property)
- **Luxury/Larger Properties**: $25,000-$50,000+
- **Replacement Cycle**: Every 5+ years
- **Includes**: Furniture, decor, kitchenware, linens, towels, appliances

**Cleaning:**
- **Small Spaces**: $65 per turnover
- **Large Homes** (6+ bedrooms): $200+ per turnover
- **Scope**: Far beyond basic cleaning—laundry, staging, restocking essentials
- **Variable Cost**: Tied to occupancy; more bookings = more cleaning costs

**Management Fees:**
- **Property Management**: 20-25% of revenue
- **Onboarding Fees**: $300-$1,000 per property
- **Includes**: Guest communication 24/7, booking management, pricing optimization, maintenance coordination

**Platform Fees:**
- **Airbnb Host Fee** (2026): 15.5% of booking (single-fee model)
- **Split-Fee Alternative**: 3% host + 14-15% guest (limited availability)

**Utilities:**
- Higher than LTR due to guest behavior (don't optimize lights/AC/heating)
- Budget 1.5-2x normal residential usage

**Supplies & Restocking:**
- Ongoing: Toilet paper, paper towels, soap, shampoo, coffee, cleaning supplies
- Per-booking costs add up with high turnover

**Maintenance:**
- Higher frequency than LTR due to guest turnover and wear
- Immediate response required (can't wait for lease end)
- HVAC, plumbing, appliance repairs more frequent

**Operating Expense Summary:**
- **LTR Operating Costs**: ~15% of revenue
- **STR Operating Costs**: ~50-60% of revenue

---

### Regulatory Risk Checklist

**Permits & Licensing:**
- [ ] Research local registration requirements
- [ ] Budget for licensing fees ($50-$500+ annually)
- [ ] Ensure compliance with display requirements (license numbers on listings)
- [ ] Timeline example: Austin effective July 1, 2026—platforms must display valid license numbers

**Zoning:**
- [ ] Verify zoning allows STR at specific property address
- [ ] Check if city limits STRs to certain zones
- [ ] Review primary residence requirement (60%+ of cities with STR rules now require renting only primary home)
- [ ] Check occupancy limits (days per year caps: 90-180 days common)

**HOA Restrictions:**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Request and read CC&Rs before purchase
- [ ] Verify current HOA rules allow STRs
- [ ] Assess risk of future HOA vote to ban STRs
- [ ] **Example**: Phoenix host bought condo for Airbnb; HOA voted to ban all STRs 6 months later

**Tax Registration:**
- [ ] Identify transient occupancy tax (TOT) or hotel tax requirements
- [ ] Determine collection and remittance requirements
- [ ] Check if platform collects/remits automatically or host must comply

**Major City Restrictions:**
- New York, San Francisco, Seattle: Strict occupancy limits, zoning restrictions, permit requirements
- Can make STRs financially unviable in these markets

**Risk Mitigation Process:**
1. Research city/county STR ordinances
2. Verify zoning allows STR at specific property address
3. Obtain and review HOA CC&Rs in full
4. Check permit/license requirements and costs
5. Understand tax obligations
6. Budget for compliance costs (legal, accounting, licenses)
7. Monitor regulatory changes (many cities tightening rules in 2025-2026)

---

### STR vs LTR Comparison

**Income Potential:**
- **STR**: 30% higher annual revenue on average
- **STR Monthly Average**: $4,300
- **Example**: $2,000/month LTR vs. $4,500/month STR (at $150/night, 80% occupancy)

**Operating Costs:**
- **LTR**: ~15% of revenue
- **STR**: ~50-60% of revenue

**Management Intensity:**
- **LTR**: Passive after tenant placement; occasional maintenance; annual renewals
- **STR**: "Hospitality work, not passive investing"
  - 24/7 guest communication
  - Cleaning after every guest
  - Constant restocking
  - Immediate maintenance responses
  - Dynamic pricing management

**Occupancy & Stability:**
- **LTR**: 90%+ occupancy with year-long leases; predictable income
- **STR**: 54.9% average occupancy; significant seasonal volatility; revenue uncertainty

**Regulatory Risk:**
- **LTR**: Minimal regulatory risk; established landlord-tenant law
- **STR**: High regulatory risk (changing ordinances, HOA bans, zoning restrictions, primary residence requirements)

**Break-Even Analysis Factors:**
1. STR restrictions are deal-breakers—verify legality before analyzing numbers
2. Use conservative occupancy assumptions with local market data (AirDNA)
3. Include all STR-specific expenses
4. Value management time honestly if self-managing
5. Model high/low seasons separately

**Hybrid Strategy:**
- Run as STR during peak tourist seasons
- Switch to monthly rentals during slow periods
- Maximizes income while reducing vacancy risk

**Decision Matrix:**

**Choose STR if:**
- Market has strong tourism/business travel demand
- STRs are legal and HOA permits
- Property can command premium nightly rates
- You have time for active management OR can afford 20-25% management fees
- You can absorb seasonal income volatility

**Choose LTR if:**
- STR restrictions prohibit or severely limit operations
- Prefer passive income and stability
- Market rental demand is strong
- Property location doesn't support premium STR rates
- You want 90%+ occupancy certainty

## Land & Development

### Development Pro Forma

**Core Pro Forma Equation:**

```
Total Development Cost = Land Cost + Hard Costs + Soft Costs + Financing Costs
```

Compare to:
- Projected Sale Value (for-sale developments)
- Stabilized NOI ÷ Cap Rate (income-producing assets)

**Main Components:**
1. Project timelines (construction phases, absorption periods, lease-up/sell-out schedules)
2. Hard costs (physical construction)
3. Soft costs (indirect expenses)
4. Absorption rates (speed of units/space sold or leased)
5. Revenue projections (sale prices or rental income)
6. Structured financing (construction loans, mezzanine debt, equity)
7. Desired return parameters (IRR, equity multiple, profit margin targets)

---

### Hard vs Soft Costs

**Hard Costs (70-80% of total budget):**
- Physical materials: steel, concrete, wood, glass
- Building systems: HVAC, plumbing, electrical
- Interior finishes and furnishings
- Labor: contractor and subcontractor wages
- Equipment rental
- Site work: grading, utilities, landscaping

**Characteristics:**
- Tangible, physical components
- Incurred during construction phase only
- Easier to estimate and finance

**Soft Costs (20-30% of total budget):**
- Architectural and engineering services
- Permits and regulatory fees
- Legal and financial services (attorneys, accountants)
- Insurance (builder's risk, liability)
- Consulting services (environmental, geotechnical, traffic)
- Project management and owner's representative
- Marketing and leasing costs
- Property taxes during construction
- Impact fees and development fees

**Characteristics:**
- Intangible, non-physical expenses
- Incurred throughout entire project lifecycle (often before construction begins)
- Difficult to finance (not tangible assets)
- Often financed through construction loan or developer equity

**Financing Considerations:**
- Loan costs and financing fees typically NOT capitalized into project basis
- Many developers finance soft costs through multifamily construction loans
- Soft costs precede construction, requiring upfront capital

---

### Absorption Rate Analysis

**Definition**: Difference between occupied space at beginning and end of time period, measuring rate at which inventory is sold or leased.

**Calculation:**

```
Absorption Rate = Number of Homes/Units Sold (or Leased) in Time Period ÷ Number of Homes/Units Available
```

**Example:**
- 50 homes sold in 3 months
- 200 homes available
- Absorption Rate = 50 ÷ 200 = 25% quarterly (or 100% annualized)

**Market Indicators:**
- **20% or Higher**: Seller's market; high demand
- **15-20%**: Neutral market
- **Below 15%**: Buyer's market; lower demand

**Developer Application:**
- High absorption rates justify new development projects
- Low absorption rates lead to slowdown in new construction
- Absorption trends guide planning for development type/amount

**Key Factors Influencing Absorption:**
- Economic conditions and job growth
- Population growth and demographic changes
- Interest rates and financing availability
- Seasonality and market cycles
- New construction and competitive supply

**Pro Forma Integration:**
- Determines sell-out or lease-up timeline
- Directly impacts cash flow waterfall modeling
- Affects carrying costs and construction loan duration
- Used to model phased delivery of inventory

### Entitlement Risk Assessment

**Legal Permissibility Criteria (First test of Highest & Best Use):**
- [ ] Is proposed use legal under existing zoning?
- [ ] Compliance with building codes, environmental regulations, bylaws
- [ ] Reasonable probability of securing:
  - [ ] Zoning variances or changes
  - [ ] Building permits
  - [ ] Environmental clearances
  - [ ] Subdivision approvals

**Risk Assessment Factors:**
- **Local Planning Climate**: Pro-growth vs. slow-growth politics
- **Public Opposition**: NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) resistance
- **Environmental Constraints**: Wetlands, endangered species, contamination
- **Infrastructure Capacity**: Water, sewer, traffic capacity
- **Approval Timeline**: Uncertainty creates holding cost risk
- **Cost of Entitlement**: Legal fees, studies, impact fees ($10,000-$50,000+ per unit)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- [ ] Pre-application meetings with planning staff
- [ ] Early environmental and engineering studies
- [ ] Community outreach before formal applications
- [ ] Contingent purchase contracts (close after entitlement)
- [ ] Entitlement consultants and land use attorneys

**Value Impact:**
- Entitled land trades at 2-3x premium vs. unentitled
- Entitlement risk = higher return requirements (20-30% IRR)

---

### Highest and Best Use Framework

**Definition**: The reasonably probable and legal use of vacant land or improved property that is physically possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and results in highest value.

**The Four Criteria Framework:**

1. **Legal Permissibility**
   - Proposed use must be legal under existing zoning/regulations
   - OR reasonable probability of securing entitlements (variances, rezoning)

2. **Physical Possibility**
   - Land can physically support proposed use
   - Topography, soil conditions, size, shape, access
   - Utilities and infrastructure availability

3. **Financial Feasibility**
   - Development can be completed in financially sound manner
   - Projected revenues exceed costs
   - Achieves market rate returns for risk level

4. **Maximum Productivity**
   - Among all feasible options, which generates highest value/return?
   - Weighs return relative to risk
   - Considers absorption timelines, capital needs, exit strategy

**Analysis Process:**
1. Identify all legally permissible uses
2. Screen for physical possibility
3. Analyze financial feasibility of remaining options
4. Compare remaining uses for highest value/lowest risk combination

**Modern Analysis Tools:**
- GIS (Geographic Information Systems): Layer topography, zoning, roads, environmental constraints
- Spatial analysis of comparable developments

**Risk-Adjusted Returns:**
- Compare uses seeking highest return RELATIVE to risk
- Higher-risk uses (luxury condos) require higher IRR hurdles than lower-risk uses (workforce apartments)

---

### Cost Escalation Modeling

**Escalation Formula:**

```
Escalation = Actual Costs - Estimated Costs
```

**Common Approach (Oversimplified):**
- General escalation: 3-5% per annum
- Based on broader inflation rates
- **Problem**: Assumes all trades escalate uniformly (rarely true)

**Trade-Specific Approach (More Accurate):**
- Each trade (concrete, steel, electrical, plumbing) escalates at different rates
- Requires trade-by-trade cost indexing
- Accounts for material supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, commodity swings

**Cost Index Methods:**

**Input-Based Indices:**
- Track changes in cost of inputs (labor and materials basket)
- Example: Engineering News Record (ENR) Building Cost Index (BCI) and Construction Cost Index (CCI)

**Output-Based Indices:**
- Track changes in completed project costs
- Reflect actual market pricing

**Timeline-Based Escalation Modeling:**
- Concrete work scheduled for Month 3: Apply 3 months of concrete cost escalation
- Electrical work scheduled for Month 9: Apply 9 months of electrical escalation
- More accurate than blanket percentage

**Example:**
- Concrete scheduled Month 3 → Apply 3 months escalation
- Electrical scheduled Month 9 → Apply 9 months escalation

**Best Practices:**
1. Use trade-specific escalation rates, not blanket percentages
2. Tie escalation to project schedule (when work occurs)
3. Build contingencies for escalation uncertainty (5-10% of hard costs)
4. Update estimates quarterly during pre-construction
5. Lock in pricing through GMP (Guaranteed Maximum Price) contracts where possible
6. Monitor commodity indices (steel, lumber, fuel) for leading indicators
