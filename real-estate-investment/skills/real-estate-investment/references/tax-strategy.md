## Depreciation Schedules

### MACRS Recovery Periods

| Property Type | Recovery Period | Method | Convention |
|--------------|----------------|--------|------------|
| Residential Rental (IRC §168(c)) | 27.5 years | Straight-line | Mid-month |
| Commercial/Nonresidential | 39 years | Straight-line | Mid-month |
| Land | NOT depreciable | N/A | N/A |

**Qualifying Residential**: 80%+ gross rental income from dwelling units (apartments, SFR, duplexes).

### Component Depreciation Classes

| Class | Recovery Period | Depreciation Method | Common Property Types |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 5-Year | 5 years | 200% DB | Appliances, carpeting, furniture, computers |
| 7-Year | 7 years | 200% DB | Office furniture/fixtures, machinery/equipment |
| 15-Year | 15 years | 150% DB | Land improvements (parking, sidewalks, fencing, landscaping), QIP |

**Qualified Improvement Property (QIP)** — 2025 Update:
- Interior improvements to nonresidential buildings (excludes structural enlargements, elevators, internal framework)
- 15-year MACRS recovery period
- **After January 19, 2025**: 100% bonus depreciation eligible
- **January 1-19, 2025**: 40% bonus depreciation
- **Section 179**: $2.5M maximum (up from $1.25M), $4M phase-out threshold

### Land vs. Building Allocation

**IRS Standard (Treasury Reg §1.167(a)-5)**: Allocate by fair market value.

**Allocation Methods (IRS preference order):**
1. Professional appraisal (most defensible)
2. County tax assessor allocation (commonly used, not always accurate)
3. Independent FMV analysis (comparables, insurance values, cost approach)

**IRS Scrutiny**: Land <10-15% of total value may trigger audit in urban areas.

### Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Residential Rental**
- Purchase: $550,000 | Land: $100,000 | Building: $450,000
- Annual depreciation: $450,000 ÷ 27.5 = **$16,364/year**
- Year 1 (purchased July): $16,364 × 5.5/12 = **$7,500**

**Example 2: Commercial Property**
- Purchase: $2,000,000 | Land: $300,000 | Building: $1,700,000
- Annual depreciation: $1,700,000 ÷ 39 = **$43,590/year**
- Year 1 (placed in service March): $43,590 × 9.5/12 = **$34,522**

**Example 3: Component Depreciation Impact**
- Purchase: $1,000,000 residential | Land: $150,000
- With segregation: Building $700,000 (27.5yr), Personal property $100,000 (5yr), Land improvements $50,000 (15yr)

Year 1 depreciation:
- Building: $700,000 ÷ 27.5 = $25,455
- Personal property: $100,000 × 20% = $20,000
- Land improvements: $50,000 × 5% = $2,500
- **Total: $47,955**

Without segregation: $850,000 ÷ 27.5 = **$30,909**
**Additional deduction: $17,046**

---

## Cost Segregation

### Methodology

Engineering-based study reclassifies building components from 27.5/39-year to 5/7/15-year classes.

**Process**:
1. Property analysis (site visit or virtual inspection, review construction documents)
2. Component classification (personal property, land improvements, building structure)
3. IRS-compliant documentation and audit support

### 2025 Legislative Change: 100% Bonus Depreciation

**One Big Beautiful Bill Act** (PL 119-21, signed July 4, 2025):
- **100% bonus depreciation** for property acquired/placed in service **after January 19, 2025 through December 31, 2030**
- Applies to 5/7/15-year property (NOT 27.5/39-year building structure)
- No retroactive relief for 2023-2024 purchases

**Phase-Down Schedule**:
- 2023: 80% | 2024: 60% | Jan 1-19, 2025: 40%
- **After Jan 19, 2025-2030: 100%**
- After 2030: Subject to future legislation

### Typical Savings by Property Value

| Property Value | Typical Cost Seg % | Accelerated Depreciation | Tax Savings (37% rate) | Study Cost | ROI |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----|
| $1M Commercial | 20-30% | $200K-$300K | $74K-$111K | $8K-$12K | 6x-14x |
| $3M Multifamily | 20-25% | $600K-$750K | $222K-$278K | $20K-$25K | 9x-14x |
| $10M Hotel/Specialty | 30-40% | $3M-$4M | $1.11M-$1.48M | $50K-$75K | 15x-30x |

**Study Cost Ranges**:
- Streamlined: $1,200-$5,000
- Detailed: $5,000-$25,000
- Large/complex: $25,000-$75,000+

**Minimum Thresholds**:
- $250K+: Worthwhile for high-income investors (especially STRs)
- $500K+: Generally recommended
- $750K+: Engineering-based study typically justified

### Worked Example: $1M Commercial Property (July 2025)

**Land**: $150,000 | **Depreciable basis**: $850,000

**Without Cost Segregation**:
- $850,000 ÷ 39 years × 5.5/12 = **$10,043** Year 1

**With Cost Segregation**:
- Building (39yr): $550,000 → $550,000 ÷ 39 × 5.5/12 = $6,490
- Personal property (5yr): $150,000 → 100% bonus = $150,000
- Land improvements (15yr): $100,000 → 100% bonus = $100,000
- QIP (15yr): $50,000 → 100% bonus = $50,000
- **Total Year 1: $306,490**

**Tax Savings**:
- Additional depreciation: $296,447
- At 37% rate: **$109,685**
- At 24% rate: **$71,147**

### When Cost Segregation Makes Sense

**Ideal Candidates**:
- Commercial $750K+, multifamily $500K+
- Recent purchases (current tax year)
- Properties with high personal property content (hotels, restaurants, medical)
- High-income investors who can utilize losses
- Active business participants (not purely passive)

**Consider Carefully**:
- Properties <$250K (cost may exceed benefit)
- Purchases many years ago (fewer remaining years)
- Passive investors subject to PAL limitations
- Properties planned for near-term sale (depreciation recapture)

**Timing**: Can apply retroactively via Form 3115 (change in accounting method).

### Interaction with Passive Activity Loss Rules

**Critical Limitation**: Accelerated depreciation only valuable if you can **use** deductions.

**Real Estate Professional Status** (see Entity Structure section):
- If qualified and materially participating: rental losses NOT passive
- Can fully utilize cost seg deductions against ordinary income
- Without status: passive losses limited to $25K offset (phased out by MAGI $100K-$150K)

**Excess Business Loss Limitation (IRC §461(l))**:
- 2025 threshold: $313K (single) / $626K (joint)
- Bonus depreciation can trigger limitation
- Consider 15-year QIP election instead of 100% bonus if near threshold

## 1031 Exchange

### Like-Kind Requirements (IRC §1031)

**Post-2017 TCJA**: Real property only (personal property excluded).

**Broad Definition**:
- Apartment → office ✓
- Raw land → retail ✓
- SFR rental → industrial warehouse ✓
- U.S. property only (foreign property NOT like-kind)

**Excluded Property**:
- Primary residence (unless partial investment use per Rev Proc 2005-14)
- Property held for sale (inventory, flips)
- Stocks, bonds, partnership interests

**Use Requirement**: Both properties held for investment/business (intent matters).

### Timeline Requirements

```
Day 0: Close on Relinquished Property
  ↓
Day 45: Identification Deadline (strict, no extensions)
  ↓
Day 180: Exchange Completion Deadline
         OR Tax Return Due Date (whichever is earlier)
```

**45-Day Identification Rules**:
- **3-Property Rule**: Identify up to 3 properties (any value)
- **200% Rule**: Unlimited properties, total FMV ≤200% of relinquished value
- **95% Rule**: Unlimited properties/value, must acquire 95% of identified value

**180-Day Exchange Period**:
- Runs concurrently with 45-day (not in addition)
- Must close by earlier of: (a) 180 days after sale, OR (b) tax return due date (with extensions)

**Critical Example** (Q4 2025 sale):
- Sell: November 1, 2025
- 45-day deadline: December 16, 2025
- 180-day deadline: April 30, 2026
- Tax return due (no extension): April 15, 2026
- **Actual deadline: April 15, 2026** (file extension for full 180 days)

### Boot Calculation

**Boot** = non-like-kind property received (cash, debt relief, personal property). Boot is **taxable**.

**Formula**:
```
Taxable Boot = Cash Boot + Mortgage Boot
Mortgage Boot = MAX(0, Debt Relinquished - Debt Replacement - Cash Added)
```

**Examples**:

| Scenario | Relinquished | Replacement | Boot | Tax Impact |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------|------------|
| Cash Boot | $1M value, $300K debt | $900K value, $250K debt | $50K cash | $50K taxable |
| Mortgage Boot | $1M value, $400K debt | $950K value, $350K debt | $100K total | $100K taxable |
| Offset with Cash | $800K value, $300K debt | $1M value, $250K debt + $50K cash added | $0 | $0 taxable |

**Rules to Avoid Boot**:
1. Trade equal or up (replacement value ≥ relinquished value)
2. Reinvest all equity
3. Replace or exceed debt (new debt ≥ old debt, OR add cash to offset)

### Depreciation Recapture (Section 1250)

**Complete Exchange (No Boot)**:
- Capital gain AND depreciation recapture **fully deferred**
- Recapture carries over to replacement property
- Recognized on eventual taxable sale

**Partial Exchange (Boot Received)**:
- Depreciation recapture taxed **first** (before capital gain)
- Recapture amount = lesser of (a) boot received, or (b) accumulated depreciation
- Recapture taxed at **25%** (unrecaptured Section 1250 gain)

**Example**:
- Original cost: $500K (land $100K, building $400K)
- Accumulated depreciation: $150K
- Adjusted basis: $350K | Sale: $800K | Gain: $450K

**If sold outright**: $150K recapture (25%) + $300K capital gain (15-20%)
**If 1031 with $50K boot**: $50K recapture (25%) + $100K deferred recapture + $400K deferred gain

### Reverse and Improvement Exchanges

**Reverse Exchange**:
- Acquire replacement **before** selling relinquished
- Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (EAT) holds property temporarily
- 180-day maximum, 45-day identification of relinquished property
- More complex/expensive (adds $5K-$15K to costs)
- Financing challenges (loans in EAT name)

**Improvement/Construction Exchange**:
- Use exchange funds for construction/improvements during 180-day period
- EAT holds title during construction
- Only **completed** improvements count (unfinished = boot)
- 180 days often insufficient for major projects

### Qualified Intermediary (QI) Requirements

**Independence**: Cannot be taxpayer or disqualified person (within 2 years):
- Employee, attorney, accountant, investment banker, broker, agent
- Family members, related entities (>50% common ownership)

**Fund Control**:
- Taxpayer cannot have "constructive receipt" of proceeds
- Direct receipt = immediate taxation, disqualifies exchange

**Due Diligence** (QI industry largely unregulated):
- Verify E&O insurance, fidelity bond
- Confirm segregated accounts, third-party CPA audit
- Check track record and financial stability

### Common Disqualification Triggers

**Fatal Errors**:
1. **Constructive receipt** of funds (even temporarily)
2. **Missing deadlines** (45-day/180-day absolute, no extensions)
3. **Disqualified person as QI**
4. **Related party exchange** without 2-year hold requirement
5. **Property not held for investment** (primary residence, immediate flip)
6. **Improper identification** (vague, exceeds limits, late)
7. **Title mismatch** (taxpayer on relinquished ≠ taxpayer on replacement)

**Best Practices**:
- Engage QI before listing property
- Include 1031 cooperation clause in contracts
- Identify replacement well before day 45
- Trade equal or up (value and debt)
- Document investment intent (leases, hold period)
- File tax extension if closing near return due date

## Bonus Depreciation

### Current Law: One Big Beautiful Bill Act (2025-2030)

**Legislative Change**:
- Prior phase-down: 40% (2025), 20% (2026), 0% (2027+)
- **OBBBA (PL 119-21, July 4, 2025)**: **100% bonus** for property acquired/placed in service **after January 19, 2025**

**Effective Dates**:
- Jan 1-19, 2025: 40%
- **After Jan 19, 2025 - Dec 31, 2030: 100%**
- 2023: 80% | 2024: 60%
- After 2030: Subject to future legislation

**No Retroactive Relief** for 2023-2024 purchases.

### Qualifying Property

**Recovery Period Requirement**: ≤20 years

**Real Estate Qualifying**:
- 5-year: Appliances, carpeting, furniture
- 7-year: Fixtures, equipment
- 15-year: Land improvements, QIP

**Real Estate NON-Qualifying**:
- 27.5-year: Residential building structure
- 39-year: Commercial building structure
- Land: Not depreciable

**Interaction**: Cost segregation identifies 5/7/15-year components eligible for 100% bonus.

### Qualified Production Property (QPP) — NEW 2025

**Definition**: Newly constructed nonresidential property for manufacturing/production/refining in U.S.

**Significance**: **Rare exception** allowing 100% write-off of 39-year building structure for qualified facilities.

### Interaction with Passive Activity Loss Rules

**Passive Activity Limitation (IRC §469)**:
- Rental real estate generally passive
- Passive losses offset passive income only
- $25K allowance for active participants (MAGI <$100K, phased out by $150K)

**Real Estate Professional Exception**:
- Qualifies if: (a) RE professional status, AND (b) material participation
- Rental losses NOT passive → fully deductible against ordinary income
- 100% bonus depreciation fully usable in current year

**Excess Business Loss (IRC §461(l))**:
- 2025 limit: $313K (single) / $626K (joint)
- Bonus depreciation can trigger limitation
- Consider electing out for QIP (15-year straight-line) if near threshold

### Election Out of Bonus Depreciation

**When to Consider**:
- Subject to passive loss limitations
- Prefer spreading deductions over time
- Near excess business loss threshold
- AMT considerations

**How to Elect Out**:
- Make election on timely-filed return (with extensions)
- Applies to entire asset class (cannot cherry-pick)
- Election irrevocable

**QIP Options**:
- 100% bonus (immediate)
- 15-year straight-line (spread evenly)
- Section 179 (up to $2.5M in 2025, subject to income/investment limits)

### Example: Residential with Cost Seg and 100% Bonus

**Property (March 2025)**: $1M purchase | Land: $200K | Depreciable: $800K

**Cost Seg Allocations**:
- Building (27.5yr): $500K
- 5-year property: $200K
- 15-year land improvements: $100K

**Without Bonus**:
- Building: $500K ÷ 27.5 × 9.5/12 = $14,495
- 5-year: $200K × 20% × 50% = $20,000
- 15-year: $100K × 5% × 50% = $2,500
- **Total Year 1: $36,995**

**With 100% Bonus**:
- Building: $14,495
- 5-year: $200K × 100% = $200,000
- 15-year: $100K × 100% = $100,000
- **Total Year 1: $314,495**

**Tax savings (37% bracket)**: $314,495 × 37% = **$116,363**

---

## Opportunity Zones

### Permanent Status (2025 Legislative Changes)

**OBBBA (July 4, 2025)**:
- Made Opportunity Zones **permanent** (sunset provisions repealed)
- Different rules for investments through 2026 vs. 2027+
- **Redesignation**: July 1, 2026, then every 10 years

**8,700+ designated census tracts** nationwide (verify via IRS/Treasury CDFI maps).

### Investment Timeline: Through 2026 vs. 2027+

| Timeline | Investments Through Dec 31, 2026 | Investments After Dec 31, 2026 |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Gain Deferral** | Earlier of: (a) QOF sale/disposal, OR (b) Dec 31, 2026 sunset | **5 years from QOF investment** OR sale |
| **5-Year Step-Up** | 10% of deferred gain excluded | 10% of deferred gain excluded |
| **7-Year Step-Up** | Additional 5% (15% total) | Eliminated |
| **10-Year Exclusion** | 100% exclusion of QOF gain | 100% exclusion of QOF gain |

**Note**: 7-year step-up no longer achievable for 2025-2026 investments (would require 2019 investment to reach 7 years by 2026).

### QOF and QOZP Requirements

**Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF)**:
- Corporation or partnership
- 90% of assets in Qualified Opportunity Zone Property (QOZP)
- Self-certifies via Form 8996
- Capital gains invested within **180 days** of realization

**Qualified Opportunity Zone Property (QOZP)**:
1. QO Zone Stock (C-corp at original issue)
2. QO Zone Partnership Interest (acquired for cash)
3. QO Zone Business Property (tangible property, original use OR substantially improved)

**Substantial Improvement**: Improvements within 30 months ≥ adjusted basis.

### Capital Gains Benefits

**Three Potential Benefits**:

1. **Deferral of Original Gain**
   - Defer recognition until sale or 5-year mark (post-2026 investments)
   - For through-2026 investments: specific sunset dates apply

2. **Step-Up in Basis on Deferred Gain**
   - 5-year hold: 10% of deferred gain permanently excluded
   - 7-year hold (pre-2027 only): 15% of deferred gain excluded

3. **Exclusion of QOF Gain (10-Year Hold)**
   - Make election to step up basis to FMV on sale
   - **All appreciation** on QOF investment **tax-free**

**Example**:
- Invest $1M gain in QOF
- Hold 5 years: $100K original gain excluded (10%)
- Hold 10 years, QOF grows to $2.5M
- Sell: $1.5M appreciation **100% tax-free** (with election)

### Qualified Rural Opportunity Funds (QROF) — NEW 2025

**Definition**: QOF invested in rural Opportunity Zones (population <50K or outside metro areas).

**Enhanced Benefit**: **30% step-up** at 5-year hold (vs. 10% for standard QOF).

**Example**:
- Invest $1M in QROF
- Hold 5 years: $300K permanently excluded
- Hold 10 years: still eligible for 100% exclusion of QROF gain

### Interaction with Other Strategies

**1031 vs. Opportunity Zone**:
- 1031: Real estate only, full deferral, no exclusion, reinvest all proceeds
- OZ: Any capital gain, partial deferral, 10-year exclusion, invest gain only
- Can combine: 1031 exchange → later sell replacement → invest gain in QOF

**Cost Seg + OZ**: Depreciation benefits separate from OZ capital gains benefits.

**OZ Real Estate Development**: Ground-up development with large appreciation potential maximizes 10-year exclusion benefit.

### Risks and Considerations

- **Illiquidity**: 10-year hold for maximum benefit
- **Operating business risk**: Must invest in active businesses (not just passive RE)
- **Compliance**: 90% asset test (semi-annual), substantial improvement requirements
- **Fund manager selection**: Varied quality, evaluate track record/fees/alignment
- **Regulatory changes**: OZ rules evolved since 2017, future changes possible

## Entity Structure

### Comparison Table

| Entity | Liability Protection | Tax Treatment | Best For | Key Limitation |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Single-Member LLC** | Good (state-dependent) | Disregarded (Schedule E) | 1-3 properties, simplicity | Weaker charging order in some states |
| **Series LLC** | Excellent (per series) | Each series separate | 5+ properties, asset isolation | Legal uncertainty, banking challenges |
| **Limited Partnership (LP)** | LP: Limited / GP: Unlimited | Pass-through (Form 1065) | Syndications, estate planning | GP liability (use LLC as GP) |
| **S-Corporation** | Good | Pass-through, no debt basis | Active business (agents, flippers) | **NOT for buy-and-hold** (debt basis issue) |
| **Land Trust** | **NONE** (privacy only) | Disregarded | Privacy + LLC as beneficiary | No asset protection alone |

### Single-Member LLC

**Advantages**:
- Liability protection (legal separation, creditor barrier)
- Pass-through taxation (Schedule E, no entity return)
- Simplicity (low setup/maintenance costs)
- Flexibility (can elect S/C-corp, add members)

**Disadvantages**:
- Limited asset protection in some states (charging order weaker)
- No SE tax savings (rental income not subject to SE tax anyway)

**Recommended For**: Individual investors, 1-3 properties, simplicity priority.

### Series LLC

**Structure**: Master LLC + multiple series (sub-LLCs), each with separate assets/liabilities.

**Availability**: Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wyoming (not all states recognize).

**Advantages**:
- Asset protection per series (liabilities isolated)
- Cost savings (one formation, lower annual fees)
- Simplified management

**Disadvantages**:
- Legal uncertainty (limited case law, bankruptcy conflicts)
- Banking/financing challenges
- Compliance complexity (strict separation required)
- California: $800/year per series (eliminates cost advantage)

**Recommended For**: 5+ properties in recognizing states, experienced investors.

### Limited Partnership (LP)

**Structure**:
- General Partner (GP): Manages, unlimited liability
- Limited Partners (LPs): Passive, limited liability

**Advantages**:
- LP asset protection (charging order, limited liability)
- Ideal for syndications (GP manages, LPs contribute capital)
- Estate planning (gift LP interests at discount)
- Flexible profit/loss allocations

**Disadvantages**:
- GP unlimited liability (**use LLC as GP**)
- Complexity/cost (partnership agreement, Form 1065)
- LP participation restrictions (cannot manage)
- Securities law concerns (Reg D compliance)

**Recommended For**: Syndications, family partnerships, large commercial deals.

**Best Practice**: LP with LLC as GP (limits GP liability).

### S-Corporation

**Advantages (Active Business Only)**:
- Self-employment tax savings (split salary/distributions)
- Pass-through taxation (no double tax)

**Example (Active Business)**:
- RE agent earning $300K
- Sole proprietor: ~$30K SE tax
- S-corp: $100K salary + $200K distribution → ~$15K FICA tax
- **Savings: ~$15K** (must pay "reasonable compensation")

**Disadvantages (Buy-and-Hold Rental)**:
- **Stock basis limitation**: Debt does NOT increase basis (unlike LLC/partnership)
- No step-up in basis on death (property inside S-corp)
- No SE tax savings for passive rental (already not subject to SE tax)
- Reasonable compensation requirement

**Stock Basis Issue Example**:
- S-corp buys $1M property: $200K equity, $800K mortgage
- Shareholder stock basis: **$200K** (debt excluded)
- LLC/partnership: member outside basis = $200K + $800K = **$1M**
- $300K loss: S-corp shareholder can deduct only $200K | LLC member can deduct full $300K

**Recommended For**: Active business (agents, brokers, flippers, developers).
**NOT Recommended For**: Buy-and-hold rental investors.

### Land Trust

**Structure**: Trust holds legal title | Beneficiary retains control (revocable).

**Advantages**:
- Privacy (beneficiary name not on public deed)
- Ease of transfer (change beneficiaries without deed recording)
- Pass-through taxation (disregarded)

**Disadvantages**:
- **NO asset protection** (creditor can reach beneficial interest)
- Does NOT replace LLC
- Trustee fees ($200-$1,000+/year)
- State-specific recognition (common in Illinois, Florida)

**Recommended Structure**:
- **Title**: Land Trust (privacy)
- **Beneficiary**: Wyoming LLC (asset protection)
- **Result**: Name off deed + charging order protection

### Asset Protection Strategies

**1. Wyoming LLC (or Nevada, Delaware)**

**Why Wyoming**:
- Charging order protection for **single-member** LLCs (rare)
- Anonymity (no public member/manager disclosure)
- No state income tax
- Strong LLC statutes

**Charging Order Protection**:
- Creditor's sole remedy: right to distributions (if/when made)
- Creditor cannot seize assets, force liquidation, take control

**Limitations**:
- Privacy ≠ asset protection (home state creditor remedies may apply)
- Single-member risk in some states → **Solution**: create multi-member LLC (add spouse/child as 1% member)

**Cost**: ~$200-$300/year (formation $100, annual report $75, registered agent $50-$150).

**2. Two-Company Structure (Management + Holding)**

**Strategy**: Separate operations (high liability) from assets (low risk).

**Structure**:
- **Management LLC**: Operates business (minimal assets, high liability)
- **Holding LLC**: Owns real estate (leases to Management LLC)

**Benefits**: Protects property from operational liabilities.

**Complications**: Formal leases, transfer pricing, two tax returns.

**Recommended For**: Active businesses, high-activity properties.

**3. Insurance (Critical Layer)**

**Required Coverage**:
- General liability: $1M-$2M
- Umbrella policy: $1M-$5M+
- Property insurance, loss of rents
- Landlord/rental dwelling policy

**Additional**: Flood, earthquake, workers' comp, EPLI (employment practices).

**Best Practices**:
- Maintain adequate limits (review annually)
- Name LLC as insured (not just individual)
- Verify coverage for rental/investment use

**4. Layered Structure**

**Example**:
1. **Property Title**: Illinois Land Trust (privacy)
2. **Beneficiary**: Wyoming LLC (asset protection)
3. **Member**: Revocable living trust (estate planning)

**Result**: Privacy (name off deed) + asset protection (charging order) + estate planning (avoid probate).

### Syndication Structures (GP/LP)

**Purpose**: Raise capital from passive investors for commercial RE.

**Typical Structure**: Limited Partnership or LLC (treated as partnership).

**Profit Split (Waterfall)**:

| Tier | Distribution | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Return of Capital** | LPs receive 100% of invested capital | $5M investment → $5M to LPs |
| **2. Preferred Return** | LPs receive fixed annual return (6-10%) | 8% × 5 years × $5M = $2M to LPs |
| **3. GP Catch-Up** | GP receives disproportionate share until target split | GP gets 100% until 20% of total profits |
| **4. Final Split** | Remaining cash flow split per ratio | 70/30 LP/GP or 80/20 LP/GP |

**Example Waterfall** ($5M LP investment, $8M net proceeds after 5 years):
- Tier 1 (ROC): LPs get $5M
- Tier 2 (8% pref): LPs get $2M
- Tier 3 (GP catch-up to 20%): GP gets $600K
- Tier 4 (70/30 split): LPs get $280K, GP gets $120K
- **Total**: LPs $7.28M (45.6% return) | GP $720K

**Capital Contributions**: LPs 80-95%, GP 5-20% (plus expertise/time).

**Securities Law**: Must comply with Reg D (506(b) or 506(c)) | Legal costs: $15K-$50K+.

**Recommended For**: Sponsors raising $1M+ equity, commercial RE, experienced operators.

### Passive Activity Loss Rules & Real Estate Professional Status

**General Rule (IRC §469)**: Rental real estate = passive activity.

**Consequence**: Passive losses offset passive income only (excess suspended).

**$25K Special Allowance**:
- Active participants can deduct up to $25K against non-passive income
- Active participation: make management decisions (approve tenants, set rent, repairs)
- Phase-out: $0.50 per $1 MAGI over $100K (fully phased out at $150K)

**Real Estate Professional Exception (IRC §469(c)(7))**:

**Requirements** (must meet BOTH):
1. **>50%** of personal services in real property trades/businesses, AND
2. **>750 hours** in real property trades/businesses

**Material Participation** (also required):
- >500 hours in activity, OR
- Substantially all participation, OR
- >100 hours and no one participates more, OR
- Other IRS tests

**Grouping Election**: Treat all rental activities as one (easier to meet 500-hour threshold).

**Benefits**:
- Rental losses NOT passive
- Fully deductible against wages, business income
- No $25K limitation
- **Huge benefit with cost segregation/bonus depreciation**

**Example (RE Professional)**:
- W-2 income: $200K | Rental loss: $100K (cost seg)
- Qualified as RE professional and materially participates
- **Result**: $100K fully deductible → taxable income $100K
- Tax savings at 37%: **$37,000**

**Common Scenarios**:

| Scenario | Hours/Activity | Qualification | Result |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Full-time W-2 + rentals | 2,000hr W-2 (non-RE) | Fails >50% test | NOT RE professional, passive losses |
| Full-time RE agent | 2,000hr agent, 200hr rentals | RE professional, lacks material participation | Passive losses (must group + increase to 500hr) |
| Spouse as RE pro | Spouse 800hr RE (>50%), materially participates | Qualifies (joint return) | Non-passive, offset household income |

**Documentation Requirements** (IRS heavily scrutinizes):
- Contemporaneous logs (not reconstructed)
- Detailed service descriptions
- Calendars, time tracking
- Maintenance logs, tenant communications
- **Failure to document = IRS disallows**
